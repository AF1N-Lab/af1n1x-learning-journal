I write down what I learn and make notes.

# OSI Model

## What I learned
- Difference between LAN and WAN
- How IP, subnet mask, and gateway work together
- OSI model layers and encapsulation

## Commands I used
```bash
ping 1.1.1.1
traceroute 8.8.8.8
ifconfig
arp -a
```
# Routing Basics
At the Network layer, routing protocols decide the best path for packets.

## What I learned
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** - uses link metrics to find the shortest and most reliable route.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** - simpler, chooses path based on hop count.
